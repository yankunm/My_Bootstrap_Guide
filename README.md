Bootstrap√•helps us quickly create responsive websites. It is made up of two parts: **components** and **the grid system**.

## Bootstrap Basics

### Getting Started

Include Bootstrap's CSS with CDN (Bootstrap's Content Delivery Network):
```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-T3c6CoIi6uLrA9TneNEoa7RxnatzjcDSCmG1MXxSR1GAsXEV/Dwwykc2MPK8M2HN" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

Include Bootstrap's JS with CDN:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-C6RzsynM9kWDrMNeT87bh95OGNyZPhcTNXj1NW7RuBCsyN/o0jlpcV8Qyq46cDfL" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### Components

Componenets are prebuilt things like buttons to put into your website. Every component is enacted via **classes** that are predefined in the Boostrap CSS.

Some important things to know are:
* **[Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/)** - Buttons with a bunch of categories

### Layout

* **[Containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/)** - responsive, fixed-width container (when you shrink window, you can see the break points and padding)

### Content

* **[Typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/typography/)** - Display Headings, lead paragraphs, blockquotes, etc.

### Utilities

Utilities don't stand alone, we add them onto something.

### The Grid System

The grid systems helps you customize and create responsive layouts.
